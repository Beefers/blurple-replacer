# unblurple
A small piece of SCSS which aims to replace all instances of Discord's default accent colour (blurple).

## How to use
### Add this to your CSS or SCSS file, preferably at or near the top:
```
https://rem-cord.github.io/unblurple/main.scss
```


### Add this into your project's root:
```
--unblurple: #7289da; 
```
* Then define a colour, in place of `#7289da`
* It can be HEX, RGB, RGBA, or anything else SCSS supports
* Enjoy!
